## User Story
Dr. Collins is an Hospital Administrator with 15 years in healthcare operations and hospital management. He needs a dashboard to analyse Emergency Rooms (ER) data in the hospital.
This dashboard should allow me to identify key operational patterns such as average patient wait times, department referral volumes, and satisfaction scores, broken down by demographics like age, gender and race.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about resource allocation, staffing schedules, and care process improvements - ultimately reducing wait times, improving patient satisfaction, and ensuring equitable healthcare delivery across all patient groups.
